        <h2>Etymology</h2>
        <p>
          The word coffee entered the English language in 1582 via the Dutch
          koffie, borrowed from the Ottoman Turkish kahve (قهوه), borrowed in
          turn from the Arabic qahwah (قَهْوَة).[12] The Arabic word qahwah was
          traditionally held to refer to a type of wine whose etymology is given
          by Arab lexicographers as deriving from the verb قَهِيَ qahiya, 'to
          lack hunger', in reference to the drink's reputation as an appetite
          suppressant. The term coffee pot dates from 1705.[13] The expression
          coffee break was first attested in 1952.[13]

        <h2>Biology</h2>
        <p>
          Several species of shrub of the genus Coffea produce the berries from
          which coffee is extracted. The two main species commercially
          cultivated are Coffea canephora (predominantly a form known as
          'robusta') and C. arabica.[43] C. arabica, the most highly regarded
          species, is native to the southwestern highlands of Ethiopia and the
          Boma Plateau in southeastern Sudan and Mount Marsabit in northern
          Kenya.[44] C. canephora is native to western and central Subsaharan
          Africa, from Guinea to Uganda and southern Sudan.[45] Less popular
          species are C. liberica, C. stenophylla, C. mauritiana, and C.
          racemosa

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          The earliest credible evidence of coffee-drinking or knowledge of the
          coffee tree appears in the middle of the 15th century in the accounts
          of Ahmed al-Ghaffar in Yemen.[2] It was here in Arabia that coffee
          seeds were first roasted and brewed in a similar way to how it is
          prepared now. Coffee was used by Sufi circles to stay awake for their
          religious rituals.[14] Accounts differ on the origin of the coffee
          plant prior to its appearance in Yemen. From Ethiopia, coffee could
          have been introduced to Yemen via trade across the Red Sea.[15] One
          account credits Muhammad Ibn Sa'd for bringing the beverage to Aden
          from the African coast.[16] Other early accounts say Ali ben Omar of
          the Shadhili Sufi order was the first to introduce coffee to
          Arabia.[17] According to al Shardi, Ali ben Omar may have encountered
          coffee during his stay with the Adal king Sadadin's companions in
          1401.
